When we moved in our new flat, there was no Internet to install on my laptop a program like alarm clock (http://alarm-clock.pseudoberries.com/).
So I tried to write my own using Python and GTK.
Here is the result, it still needs a huge amount of improvements and I am not an expert in this language so be indulgent.
Take it more like a pyGtk code example.
I am opened to all your corrections.
